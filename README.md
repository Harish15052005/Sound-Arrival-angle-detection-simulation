# Sound-Arrival-angle-detection-simulation
A small simulation for the detection of Arrival of time using TDOA(time difference of arrival) using p5.js
This is the small project to learn about the method to calculate angle of arrival of sound.

The learning from this will implemented to detect gunshots arrival using microphone array and FPGA ( for faster sampling rate ).
